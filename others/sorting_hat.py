# Exercise: Help out the sorting hat to sort the new students in the houses of Hogwarts.
# You will be receiving names until the command "Welcome!".
# The length of each name determines in which house the student is going: ·
# If the name is less than 5 chars, the student is going into Gryffindor o Print "{name}
# goes to Gryffindor." · If the name is exactly 5 chars,
# the student is going into Slytherin o Print "{name} goes to Slytherin." ·
# If the name is exactly 6 chars, the student is going into Ravenclaw o
# Print "{name} goes to Ravenclaw." · If the name is more than 6 chars,
# the student is going into Hufflepuff o Print "{name} goes to Hufflepuff."
# While receiving names, if you receive "Voldemort", print "You must not speak of that name!"
# and end the program. No more sorting for today! If all students are sorted successfully,
# print "Welcome to Hogwarts."

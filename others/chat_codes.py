# Peter is a programming enthusiast who wants to create a chat where people will
# send messages via number codes. He starts by creating a program for only four messages.
#
# Create a program that receives the n number of messages sent.
# On the following n lines, it will receive integer numbers.
# For each number, the program should print a different message: 路
# If the number is 88 - "Hello" 路 If the number is 86 - "How are you?" 路
# If the number is not 88 nor 86, and it is below 88 - "GREAT!" 路
# If the number is over 88 - "Bye.

codes_count = int(input())

for i in range(codes_count):
  code = int(input())
  if code == 88:
    print("Hello")
  elif code == 86:
    print("How are you?")
  elif code < 88 and code != 86:
    print("GREAT!")
  else:
    print("Bye.")
